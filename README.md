# Linear Regression Model Using Rust and Burn
## Introduction
* This project uses the Rust programming language and the Burn library (v0.16.0) to build a linear regression model that predicts values for the function y = 2x + 1.  The implementation simulates real-world settings using synthetic data with extra noise and teaches basic Rust machine learning ideas.
